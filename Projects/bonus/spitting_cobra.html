<p>The spitting cobra is one of several species of cobras that have the ability to eject venom from their fangs when defending themselves against predators. The sprayed venom is harmless to intact skin. However, it can cause permanent blindness if introduced to the eye and left untreated (causing chemosis and corneal swelling).</p>


<p>Spitting cobras are extremely accurate at distances over 10 feet. Some scientists theorize that the “Spitting Behavior” and evolution of the fang modifications were a result of the fact that Spitting cobras cohabitate with numerous antelope species. These scientists believe that the primary function of Spitting cobra fangs is to deter being trampled by antelope hooves. The Cobra is well equipped to spray its painful venom directly into the eyes of potential trampling animals from a safe distance. This theory is almost identical to the theory of the evolution of the “Rattlesnake Rattle” on rattlesnakes. Scientists speculate that the rattle’s main function was to alert buffalo and other grazing North American Hoovestock to their presence in order to avoid being trampled by their feet.</p>

<p>Spitting Cobras prefer to spit or spray venom into the eyes of would be attackers, threats or predators, but are perfectly capable of delivering a deadly Snake envenomation via a bite. In fact, Spitting Cobra Bites are common in some areas of Africa and are extremely painful if not deadly. In many cases, victims of Spitting Cobra Attacks become permanently blind if sprayed in the eyes. Spitting Cobra venom is very toxic and extremely deadly, although it is nothing compared to the venom of the King Cobra, which also delivers a lot of venom with each hit. But then again, being shot by a 9mm vs. a 45 still sucks big time, if you get my drift. So in reality, Spitting Cobra poison is the lesser of the two evils compared to King Cobra Poison.</p>

<p>Spitting Cobras in Captivity are much easier to care for than the King Cobra as they do not feed exclusively on snakes. Instead, Spitting Cobras feed primarily on small rodents, frogs, toads and even lizards. Captive breeding is achieved on a common basis with some specimens living over 20 years. Spitting Cobra eggs are laid under logs, in abandoned rodent burrows, termite nests or other suitable nooks and crannies. Baby Spitting Cobras are born “LOCKED AND LOADED” and pack a mean wallop if bitten. An interesting fact about captive Spitting Cobras is that the majority of them loose their desire or need to “Spray” their venom. Not that they won’t bite the be-geezers out of you if given the opportunity, they will. Most cobras are very intelligent and hate wasting venom if not necessary. Perhaps captive Cobras being fed a commercial diet of thawed rodents realize their caretaker will not “Step” on them? Who knows for sure, but many Spitting Cobras seem to lose there spitting urges in captivity. Then again, there are those individual specimens that are constantly spraying venom at any passerby. These are a major pain to manage in captivity, as you always have to wipe down their enclosure.</p>
